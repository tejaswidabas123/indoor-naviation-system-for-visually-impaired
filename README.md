ABSTRACT:

This report presents a novel Visual Positioning System (VPS) designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating indoor environments. 
Leveraging deep learning and other machine learning techniques, our project focuses on recording and analysing the surrounding area to guide users effectively. 
The study was conducted within the confines of Block 5 corridor at our university, serving as a practical application of our proposed system.
Our methodology involves capturing and processing video footage using a portable camera carried by the user. 
Users interact with an interface, inputting their destination, and our system calculates the closest and most efficient path.
Users are subsequently guided through the environment via real-time signals, indicating when to turn left, right, or proceed straight, facilitating an intuitive and seamless navigation experience.
In addition to providing navigation assistance, our Visual Positioning System (VPS) integrates advanced obstacle detection functionality based on cutting-edge object detection techniques.
This feature enhances the safety of visually impaired individuals during their navigation through indoor environments.
Our VPS system tries to offer a promising solution to enhance the independence and mobility of visually impaired individuals in indoor settings, showcasing the potential for innovative applications of deep learning and algorithmic approaches in addressing real-world challenges.
